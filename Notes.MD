### The length and breadth of a rectangle and radius of a circle are input through the keyboard. Write a script to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle as well as the area and circumference of the circle
```bash
#!/bin/sh

echo "Enter the length of the rectangle: \c"
read length

echo "Enter the breadth of the rectangle: \c"
read breadth

echo "Enter the radius of the circle: \c"
read radius

echo "Area of the rectangle is $(echo "$length*$breadth"|bc)"
echo "Perimeter of the rectangle is $(echo "2*($length+$breadth)"|bc)"
echo "Area of the circle is $(echo "3.14*$radius*$radius"|bc)"
echo "Circumference of the circle is $(echo "2*3.14*$radius"|bc)"
```
